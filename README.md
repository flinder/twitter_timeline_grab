# Twitter timeline grab

## Usage

Fill in your Twitter credentials, output file path and list of Twitter screen names in
`collect.py`. [You can also pass user ids to the twitter collector, but then the 
code checking data collected in the past has to be changed to extract the latest 
tweet by user id not screen name]

Run with: 

```{bash}
python collect.py
```
